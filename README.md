**WP-CLIENT**

Sample React Native application to provide access through Apollo to a GraphQL server serving WP JSON API data.  The HTML content is translated to markup suitable for React Native and rendered directly: this is seen as a proof-of-concept subject to further refinement.  It has been tested successfully on the iOS simulator on a Macintosh.

**Getting Started**

1. Install Node Modules 

>`yarn`

2. Install Environment for iOS simulator on Macintosh.  

3. If the latest version of XCode has not been installed on the machine, install that [from this address](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

4. Install React Native CLI

>`yarn global add react-native-cli
>`

   and start development server

>`yarn start`

If the iOS simulator does not open automatically, press 'i' to open it


The server will run on port 3000
